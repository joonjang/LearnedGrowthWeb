               These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the
               Learned Growth app and related services (the “Service”). By using
               the Service, you agree to these Terms.

         <h2>1) What Learned Growth is (and isn’t)</h2>
         <div class="card">
            <p>
               Learned Growth is a journaling and self-reflection tool inspired
               by the ABCDE framework in
               <em>Learned Optimism</em>
               . It may offer AI-generated analysis to help you reflect on your
               entries.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>Learned Growth is not medical care.</strong>
               We are not a healthcare provider and we do not provide therapy,
               diagnosis, treatment, or emergency services.
            </p>
            <p class="small">
               If you are in immediate danger or considering self-harm, contact
               local emergency services right away. (In Canada/US: call or text
               988 for the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline; if outside, use your
               local emergency number.)
            </p>
         </div>

         <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
         <p>
            You must be at least
            <strong>13 years old</strong>
            to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority where you
            live, you must have permission from a parent or legal guardian.
         </p>

         <h2>3) Accounts and login</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>
               You can sign in using email OTP, Apple Sign-In, and/or Google
               Sign-In (depending on availability).
            </li>
            <li>
               You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
               account access.
            </li>
            <li>
               You agree to provide accurate information and not impersonate
               others.
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h2>4) Your content</h2>
         <p>
            You own the journal content you create (“User Content”). You grant
            us a limited license to host, store, and process your User Content
            solely to operate the Service (including syncing, displaying, and—if
            you request—AI analysis).
         </p>

         <h3>Content rules</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Don’t use the Service for illegal activities.</li>
            <li>
               Don’t attempt to break, reverse engineer, or abuse the Service.
            </li>
            <li>Don’t upload malware or disrupt other users or our systems.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>5) AI features and limits</h2>
         <div class="card">
            <p>If you use AI analysis, you understand:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  AI outputs can be incorrect, incomplete, or unhelpful and
                  should not be relied on as professional advice.
               </li>
               <li>
                  You are responsible for how you interpret and use AI outputs.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Subscription “unlimited” may still be subject to reasonable
                  limits to prevent abuse and control costs (for example, rate
                  limits, fair use caps, or temporary throttling).
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>

         <h2>6) Subscriptions and consumables</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Some features require a paid subscription and/or consumable
               credits.
            </li>
            <li>
               Purchases are handled by Apple App Store / Google Play and are
               subject to their terms.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Subscriptions automatically renew</strong>
               unless turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current
               period.
            </li>
            <li>
               You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID or
               Google Play Account settings at any time.
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h2>10) Limitation of liability</h2>

            You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or

         </p>

         <h2>13) Governing law</h2>
         <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of British Columbia, Canada
            (without regard to conflict-of-law principles), except where your
            local consumer protection laws require otherwise.
         </p>

         <h2>14) Changes to these Terms</h2>
         <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material
            changes, we’ll take reasonable steps to notify you (for example,
            through the app or by updating the Terms on our website).
